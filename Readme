youI  can see last update
iCto ome
it Coomâ‚¬ans
Okay now lets update the data
This right? UpdateDomains.py
yes

wait put python before it
OH okay
Awesome!
and also be careful with the sheet format foe example here the first domain will not update because it is on row 2 and the program doesn' change the row two because it's for name the comlumns 
i see. The header are missing
yes and also never remove the domain and it should be clean and in the domains.json
Okay one more thing. This we need in following format 
Oh i missed the image
We need to get CURRENT data on the left instead of right
Previously was on the right
We need it in following order
CURRENT 1 WEEK AGO 2 WEEK AGO but this is the current format 
i can change it too
Cool
Lets do this
idk why sometimes i cant control your screen
Its teamvewer issue i think
what's the current format.
i mean the current format is it two weeks ago then one the current?
I think its fine
Hold on Im making it obvious for you
okay okay iknow now
Let me fill in the header 
Hold on
I cant remember these
Is this Oeganic traffic? 
then Organic pages and Referring domains?
yes but i know what you are going to do next let's consider you filled them 
Looks good
Now you can verify that those data are in correct position
Anyway its on sheet1 now?
just move the data to sheet 2
I mean .. 
Lets run it again 
Now I will run the scrpit again
we expect it will fill data on sheet2
wait 

#####
run python createSheet.py before running update
Okay
I think you missed ) on that last edit
oh yes thank you
Hehe
Lets try it now
wait dont copy that i just told you heres what to copy
and also do you remember what i told you wbout create sheet how to edit the code and choose the part you want create sheet?
I forget lot of stuff ;d
I got load of work to do so yeah I dont remember much

wait you can click on createsheet two times
ojh its' not linux just run it normally i will tell if there is something will make it easy
Okay
oh look the name of the cheet has changed 
try two clicks now
thats' because all files are linked i will add a section in config.json where you can put the name of the sheet so you will not face something like that
I see. Its currenlty on the 2 files. need to renamed in correct name as its case sensitive
yes try two click now
Looks good now
